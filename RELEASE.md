# Munder Difflin v0.2.7

**A local hive of Claude Code, Antigravity & Codex agents that run themselves** — messaging,
routing, and remembering, coordinated by a GOD orchestrator you talk to. Local-first and open source.

## What's new in 0.2.7 — *Voice, memory, floors & polish*

A feature release: talk to your agents with your voice, an enterprise Knowledge Graph,
multi-window "floors", a richer message composer with file/image attachments, agent
session resume (with Restart & Continue), drag-a-file-onto-the-terminal path injection,
the groundwork for TV-show office themes, and a redesigned landing page.

- **Free Flow voice dictation → message queue (on by default).** Hold Option to talk; your
  speech is transcribed by Groq Whisper (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`) straight into the message
  composer. Gated on a Groq API key, encrypted at rest.
- **Enterprise Knowledge Graph v1 (on by default).** A multimodal store of your own
  documents / policies / business context, with a CLI agents can query for ranked passages
  and full documents — so company-specific facts come from your data instead of guesses.
- **Multi-window "floors" (on by default).** Open isolated office windows, each with its
  own set of agents and per-PTY routing.
- **Rich message composer — file & image attachments.** Attach files/images (via a "files"
  button or paste-to-attach), shown as removable chips above a taller, resizable input;
  you can send with attachments alone.
- **Restore agent sessions across restart — with Restart & Continue.** Agents reattach their
  prior Claude conversation after an app restart: Michael resumes his session, and a restored
  worker re-enters its *existing* worktree instead of re-isolating, so uncommitted work isn't
  lost. A per-agent **Restart & Continue** button respawns a session on the same model and
  redraws a garbled terminal, and Add Agent gains a "resume session" field to reattach by id.
- **Drag a file onto a terminal to drop in its path.** Drag any file (an image, etc.) onto an
  agent's terminal and its absolute, shell-escaped path is typed into the session — so Claude
  Code detects the image and attaches it, exactly like a native terminal's drag-and-drop.
- **TV-show office themes — infrastructure (behind a flag, off by default).** A theme
  abstraction, a Settings theme picker with a destructive switch-flow, and the first themed
  map (Brooklyn-99 precinct).
- **Live GitHub star count** next to the Star buttons on the landing page.
- **Composer redesign.** A full-width input above a single tidy control bar (Delegate ·
  Attach · voice · Send).
- **Landing page redesign.** Bento layout for the #features and #why sections with new SVG
  illustrations.
- **Fullscreen tab bar no longer clipped.**
- **Slack double-ack fixed.** A single Slack message delivered as both `app_mention` and
  `message.*` is now de-duplicated by `channel:ts`.

Everything from **v0.2.6** (terminal boot-fit, dev sidecar, wall clock, Slack host-pin) and
earlier is included.

## First launch

- **macOS** — the build is **signed with a Developer ID** (hardened runtime). If macOS
  still shows an "unidentified developer" warning on first open, right-click the app →
  **Open** → **Open** once. After that, the first time agents touch a folder you'll get a
  single macOS privacy prompt for Documents/Desktop/Downloads — allow it once and the
  grant sticks (it covers the `claude` agents the app spawns), because the grant is bound
  to the app's stable signature.
- **Windows** — not code-signed yet; SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" →
  **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **Linux** — make the AppImage executable: `chmod +x Munder-Difflin-*.AppImage`, then run it.

---

## Requirements
- macOS 12+, Windows 10/11, or a modern Linux desktop
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and on your `PATH` (and/or the Antigravity `agy` or OpenAI `codex` CLI for those providers)
- A Claude Code subscription (Munder Difflin drives your existing `claude` CLI — it doesn't replace it)

---

## 🛠 Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # rebuilds node-pty for Electron
npm run dev        # launches the app with hot reload
```
Node 18+ and a C/C++ toolchain are required (Xcode CLT on macOS, Build Tools on Windows).
To produce installers yourself: `npm run dist` (current OS), or `dist:mac` / `dist:win` / `dist:linux`.

---

## What's inside
- **The simulation** — every agent is a real `claude` (or `agy` / `codex`) pseudo-terminal, visualized as an avatar on a watchable office floor (`node-pty` · `xterm.js` · Pixi.js).
- **MemPalace** — a markdown-first, semantic memory layer the whole office shares; cross-session recall in ~12ms.
- **GOD orchestrator + hive** — one agent you talk to routes work to specialists and stays autonomous, escalating only critical items (spend, destructive ops, scope) to you natively, through Claude Code's human-in-the-loop prompts.
- **Plugs into your setup** — your subscription, settings, skills, and MCP servers; `/remote-control` reaches the whole floor from your phone.
